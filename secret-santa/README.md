# Secret Santa

Given a list of players, pair up players so that:

1. Each player gives a gift once
2. Each player receives a gift once
3. Players cannot give or receive to themselves
4. Selections must be random

Example input: `['Barney', 'Wilma', 'Fred', 'Pebbles', 'Bam Bam']`

Example output: `[['Barney', 'Wilma'], ['Fred', 'Betty'], ['etc', 'etc']]`
